## ccxt_bitmex

The ccxt_bitmex task initializes a single offensive agent on the field and rewards +1 for scoring a goal and 0 otherwise. In order to score a goal, the agent will need to know how to approach the ball and kick towards the goal. The sparse nature of the goal reward makes this task very difficult to accomplish.
